# Data

Each folder is named as the original binary. Inside each folder, each `*.logs.txt` contains the number of cumulative hashes calculated, with one second measurement interval. To get the number of hashes per second, you subtract the current value to the previous one. With that many values, you can get a distribution of hashes per second.
